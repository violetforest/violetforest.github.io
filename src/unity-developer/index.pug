        | A Unity game for WebVR and Quest 2/3. I built the game with Unity and integrated it into the website. Game mechanics included picking up objects with raycast, and incorporated a timer that ran out after the house was flooded. I also integrated the assets created by the artist and producer Michelle Brown, and was given creative control over the water shader.
