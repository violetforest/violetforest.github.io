        | I completed my Masters in Fine Arts (2016) at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago 
        | in the Art & Technology program. My art practice in school involved working creatively with 
        | technology with a range of tools like Processing, Unity, app development, virtual reality, 
        | openFrameworks, and arduino/DIY electronics.

        | After grad school, I kicked off my career as a technologist in front-end and Unity development and 
        | worked as a freelancer with design studios in Chicago for 3 years (2015-2018). 
        | I evolved from front-end developer to creative technologist by blending my learnings 
        | from school into my profession.
