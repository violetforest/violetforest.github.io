    <p class="page-text">In collaboration with artist and designer Vladimir Hermand, I completed a 3-month fellowship sponsored by Tweag.io's Open Source Fellowship Program, where we built an opensource Open Bionics prosthesis that could be controlled with your phone's front-facing camera.</p>
    <p class="page-text">After a week of conducting user research and virtual interviews to understand the problems from the user's perspective, I was able to design the app and core functionalities for a minimum viable product. Vlad was able to print and assemble the Open Bionics Brunel hand, and I was able to write the code for a Bluetooth Arduino application for the hand that could communicate with a handtracking Android app, so that a user could use their phone and free hand to change the grip of their prosthesis.</p>
    <p class="page-text">We were also able to do in-person user testing with local users in Paris which provided insight into how the product could be improved for the next iteration. At the moment we don't have a next iteration planned but the project is available on Github for anyone to fork or clone. You can see the details of the project <a target="_blank" class="caption__link" href="https://mirru.app">here</a>.</p>
    <p class="page-text">
      The project was also featured on the Google Developers Blog which is available to read for a technical overview of how Mediapipe handtracking was integrated into the project.
