      | A three.js piece that was later translated into VR. You are given the ability
      | zoom in and out to look at yourself as a flower in the mirror.
      |
      | The mobile version of the website allows you to use your device's
      | orientation to move the mirror around like a pocket mirror.

      | and shown at Panke Gallery,
      | Berlin in January 2018. The IRL Show was featured as an event for
