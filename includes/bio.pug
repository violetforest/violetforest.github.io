      | I was born and raised in Miami, Florida and completed my Masters in Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois in the Art & Technology program. My art practice in school involved working creatively with technology, and I slowly blended my learnings from school into my profession.

      | I started off my career in front-end development and worked as a freelancer with design studios in Chicago for 3 years. I evolved from front-end developer to creative technologist, working with a range of tools, including computer vision, virtual reality electronics and app development. I am currently looking for opportunities that involve developing for technologies like VR/AR/MR, machine learning, computer vision, and/or 3d.
