      | I wanted to try out A-frame so I made some twisted 3d abstract models in cinema4d
      | and threw them into an A-frame scene. I also made a composition with the models in photoshop
      | and added a QR code that opens up the WebVR website, which adds another dimensional layer
      | to the composition.

        | As Bud took it from the banker’s hand, the blank page generated a nice animated color logo and music. The logo
        | developed into a peacock. Beneath it, a video presentation commenced, hosted by a similar-looking gent…
        | “‘The Parsis welcome you to Peacock Bank,’” he said.

        | This piece attempts to create a rudimentary version of Stephenson’s idea of animated paper.
        | The smartphone, a device that is always available on our body, is used to scan a QR code,
        | extending the experience of the 2D poster to a web-based virtual 3D reinterpretation.
