      "cybertwee HQ is a “virtual space for gurls + tech” produced by the cybertwee
      collective in 2016, which featured artwork by women using digital mediums. The
      space served as an exhibition for 22 cybertwee artists alongside VNS matrix
      (a pioneering cyberfeminist art collective founded in the 1990s), utilizing the
      term “headquarters” for the resulting virtual environment. Spectators visit the
      Cybertwee HQ using a Google Cardboard or tethered VR headset, and are given the
      ability to fly or teleport through the space respectively." — Crossroads The ACM Magazine for Students WINTER 2018 VOL.25 • NO.2

      A kickstarter was made to expand the virtual exhibition space into a
      non-profit gallery space that could host rotating exhibitions regularly,
      educational events,
      and create a virtual residency program for artists to transform the space.
      The Kickstarter was a flop and probably for good reasons, and the project was abandoned, but there is
      still a personal interest of pursuing the creation of a digital platform and virtual space
      that is in favor of supporting digital arts through a virtual residency program.
