“‘The Parsis welcome you to Peacock Bank,’” he said.</p><p>This piece attempts to create a rudimentary version of Stephenson’s idea of animated paper.
The smartphone, a device that is always available on our body, is used to scan a QR code,
extending the experience of the 2D poster to a web-based virtual 3D reinterpretation.</p><p>Instructions:
